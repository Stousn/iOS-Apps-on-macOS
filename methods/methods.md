# Methods
## The Idea
The main points are to reuse existing work and to reuse as much source code as possible for mobile and desktop platform. Therefore, a web search is the most fitting research method. Another goal should be that on both plaforms an native application should be possible.

## Insufficient Methods
* Web Pages
    + The web can be used for cross platform websites. Its is possible to write software for mobile and desktop using the same code.
    - Pages are presented in a webbrowser which requires internet connectivity and prohibits the installation on the device itself
* Web Apps
    + A growing possibility for cross platform applications are web apps. 
    + The browser support got better in the last years.
    + Web Apps commonly user WebWorkers/ServiceWorkers to achieve offline functionality through caching.
    + Web Applications can be "installed" on smart phones
    - Still there is not every native functionality included and polyfills are necessary to support older browsers.
    - It is heavily dependent on browsers which gets difficult for different platforms.
    - It also is not possible to install WebApps on macOS or make them feel native for user (experience)
* Ionic
    + Native cross platform applications using web technology
    + 
* Native Script
