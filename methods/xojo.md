Xojo basically is a cross platform framework that can run on any platform. It even comes with it's own IDE and provides the possibility for (Xojo) Cloud integration. It seems to be the firebase for cross platform native apps.

<!-- Who built it? -->
Initially Andrew Barry wrote CrossBasic as Macintosh Software. Later Geoff Perlman bought it as Real Software Inc (REALbasic and Real Studio) and renamed the, now cross platform, framework (language and ide) to Xojo. 

### Features
<!-- Features -->
Xojo is it's own programming language. It is object oriented and har a visual IDE. The syntax is Visual Basic like. But it should be easy to use and the output is an cross platform application for desktop and mobile operating systems. It seems that the applications can also call native functionality via an API provided by Xojo.

Xojo is not open source and proprietary. There are different licence models starting from 99\$ for a one platform lite desktop version to the Pro version for 699\$ which includes macOS, Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, database access, Web, iOS, and more.
